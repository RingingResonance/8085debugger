Detect and fix minor bugs. <- Always a problem.

Add feature to allow for auto or manual detection of other serial IO for terminal interface.

Allow for compatability with a wide range of serial IO perifrials.

Add ability to easily use custom routines for serial IO on a different ROM chip, or code loaded in RAM. <- DONE, added way for external RX and TX routines to be used.

Add memory test and burn in tests. <- Trying to keep it under 2KB so that it only requires 1 ROM chip.
